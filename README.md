# Contraceptive-use-in-Fiji-1974


Background 

Increasing access to effective modern contraception across the world has been a major public health and economic development priority over the past 50 years. Enabling women to make informed choices about their sexual and reproductive health can prevent pregnancy-related health risks, reduce risk for maternal and infant mortality, empower couples to make informed decisions about family size, and allow women to pursue education and employment opportunities. 


Aims 

The objective of this project is to provide the Fijian Ministry of Health a briefing on the current uptake of
contraceptives based on the results of the recently completed Fiji Fertility Survey in 1974.
1. Describe the overall level of current modern contraceptive use by women of reproductive age in Fiji.
2. Assess differences in contraceptive uptake by key population groups, including age, education status, region, ethnic and religious group, and number of children.
3. Are there differences in modern contraceptive uptake between the Fijian and Indian ethnic groups? Are differences explainable by differences in fertility desires or other factors?

Data 

The Fiji Fertility Survey was a nationally representative survey implemented by the Fiji Bureau of Statistics
between February and April 1974. The survey targeted of a nationally representative sample of 5,500
households from 400 primary sampling units. Ultimately, 5388 households were selected from the census
sampling frame, of which 5,180 were existing at the time of interviewing, and 4,901 were successfully contacted
and interviewed, including enumeration of all household members.

All women aged 15 to 49 years who have ever been married and were present in the household the previous
night were eligible for an extended individual questionnaire interview. A total of 5,055 eligible women were
identified in the 4,901 successfully contacted households. Of these, 4,928 completed individual interviews. The
sample was drawn such that responses were self-weighting (no need to apply differential sampling weights).

Individual survey questionnaires covered topics related to fertility and reproductive health, including:
- Basic demographic and background characteristics. 
- Number of children born, children currently surviving, and current preganancy status. 
- Awareness and use of contraceptive methods.
- Future fertility desires and intentions.
- Work history.
- Marriage history and husband's background. 

Data from the Fiji Fertility Survey are archived and available for public download in raw form from
the DHS Program website.

Steps 
- Carry out statistical analysis plan.
- Interpret the results of the analysis with respect to each of the research questions and hypotheses.
- Check any important assumptions underpinning the analysis and conclusions and conduct any sensitivity
analyses to confirm the robustness of the results. Enumerate any important limitations to the results
or interpretations.
- Contextualize the findings compared to other existing evidence.
- Identify key recommendations from the study for advanced scientific understanding, public health
policy or practice, and future research priorities.
